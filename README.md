## Getting Started

### Installation

Getting started is as simple as running our smart installer. It handles dependency checks, sets up the executable, and cleanly integrates with your shell (`bash` or `zsh`).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SplashCodeDex/Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage.git
cd Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage

# Run the installer
./install.sh

# Restart your shell or source your profile to complete the installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile
```

### Uninstallation

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory and run the installer with the --uninstall flag
./install.sh --uninstall
```

---

## Usage

The `workspace` command is the main entry point for interacting with your workspaces.

### Interactive Mode

Running `workspace` without any arguments will launch an interactive menu (using `fzf` if installed) that displays your recent workspaces, ranked by "frecency" (frequency and recency).

```bash
workspace
```

### Direct Mode

You can also interact with workspaces directly:

*   `workspace <n>`: Switch to the nth most recent workspace.
*   `workspace <name>`: Create or switch to a local workspace named `<name>`.
*   `workspace <git_url>`: Clone a git repository and create a new workspace.

### Options

*   `workspace <name> --open` or `workspace <name> -o`: After switching into a workspace, an interactive menu will appear, allowing you to open the project in your editor of choice.

### Commands

*   `workspace warm`: Manually refresh all Git-based workspaces by fetching the latest changes.
*   `workspace doctor`: Check for common problems and offer solutions.
*   `workspace sync`: Scans the current workspace for large, untracked directories and moves them to ephemeral storage.
*   `workspace --json`: Output a JSON list of workspaces for machine consumption.
*   `workspace --help`: Show this help message.

---

## Configuration

The tool is configured via files in the `scripts` and `~/.config/workspace` directories.

### Main Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `scripts/config.sh`. You can modify this file to change the default behavior of the workspace tool.

**Available Options:**

*   `WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR`: The base directory for your workspaces.
*   `EPHEMERAL_CACHE_DIR`: The directory where large directories are symlinked to.
*   `DB_FILE`: The database file for workspace history.
*   `WORKSPACE_CONFIGS_FILE`: The main configuration file for dotfile symlinks.
*   `WARMING_LOG_FILE`: The log file for the warming script.
*   `WARMING_PROJECT_COUNT`: The number of projects to pre-warm in the background.
*   `LARGE_DIR_THRESHOLD_KB`: The threshold for detecting large, untracked directories (in KB).
*   `DISABLE_AUTO_SYMLINK`: Disable automatic symlinking of large directories.

### Editor Configuration

To use the `--open` feature, you can configure your preferred editors in the `~/.config/workspace/editors.conf` file. The installer creates this file with a list of common editors.

The format is simple: `DISPLAY_NAME:COMMAND`. The command will be executed within the project's directory.

**Default `editors.conf`:**
```
# Add your custom editor commands here.
# The format is <NAME>:<COMMAND>
VS Code:code .
Vim:vim .
IntelliJ IDEA:idea .
GoLand:goland .
PyCharm:pycharm .
```
The tool is smart enough to only show you editors from this list that are actually installed on your system.

---

## Automatic Symlinking

The workspace tool automatically detects and symlinks large directories to ephemeral storage. This is done by a set of detector scripts located in `scripts/detectors`.

**Detected Directories:**

*   `build`: If a `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, or `CMakeLists.txt` file is present.
*   `dist`: If a `package.json` file is present.
*   `.idea`, `.vscode`, `.gradle`: If these directories exist.
*   `.next`: If a `next.config.js` file is present.
*   `node_modules`: If a `package.json` file is present.
*   `.nuxt`: If a `nuxt.config.js` file is present.
*   `target`: If a `Cargo.toml` or `pom.xml` file is present.
*   `vendor`: If a `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, or `composer.json` file is present.

You can also manually specify directories to be symlinked by creating a `.workspace_symlinks` file in the root of your project and listing the directory names within it.

---

## Bash Customizations

The installation script also adds some useful aliases and functions to your shell.

**Aliases:**

*   `ll`: `ls -alF`
*   `la`: `ls -A`
*   `l`: `ls -CF`
*   `alert`: An alias for sending a notification for long-running commands.
*   `clean_vscode`: Cleans up the vscode-server cache.

**Functions:**

*   `workspace`: The main function for interacting with workspaces.

## The Road Ahead

We're just getting started. Our vision is to make `workspace` an indispensable part of the modern development workflow. Here's what we're thinking about for the future:

- [ ] **Workspace Templates:** Quickly start new projects (e.g., `workspace new --template=react-vite`) with pre-configured boilerplate.

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it!
