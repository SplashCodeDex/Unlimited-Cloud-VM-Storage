## Getting Started

### Installation

Getting started is as simple as running our smart installer. It handles dependency checks, sets up the executable, and cleanly integrates with your shell (`bash` or `zsh`).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SplashCodeDex/Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage.git
cd Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage

# Run the installer
./install.sh

# Restart your shell or source your profile to complete the installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile
```

### Uninstallation

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory and run the installer with the --uninstall flag
./install.sh --uninstall
```

---

## Usage

The `workspace` command is designed to be intuitive and fast.

#### Create or Switch to a Workspace

```bash
# Use a full git URL, a project name, or a local path
workspace https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

#### View Your Workspace History

Run `workspace` with no arguments to see your "frecency"-ranked list of projects in an interactive menu.

```bash
workspace
```

#### Syncing a Workspace

The `workspace` tool can automatically detect and move large, untracked directories (like `node_modules`) to ephemeral storage to save space. This scan is performed automatically when you create or open a workspace.

However, if you create a large directory after the initial scan, you can manually trigger the scan by running the `workspace sync` command from within your workspace directory.

```bash
workspace sync
```

#### Commands

*   `workspace sync`: Scans the current workspace for large, untracked directories and moves them to ephemeral storage.
*   `workspace warm`: Fetches the latest changes for all your Git-based workspaces.
*   `workspace doctor`: Runs a health check on your environment to diagnose and fix common issues.
*   `workspace --json`: Outputs a machine-readable list of all workspaces, used by the VS Code extension.

## The Road Ahead

We're just getting started. Our vision is to make `workspace` an indispensable part of the modern development workflow. Here's what we're thinking about for the future:

- [ ] **Workspace Templates:** Quickly start new projects (e.g., `workspace new --template=react-vite`) with pre-configured boilerplate.

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it!
