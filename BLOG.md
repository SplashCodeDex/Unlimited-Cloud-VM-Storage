# Announcing Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage v2.0: Now with a VS Code Extension!

I'm thrilled to announce the release of Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage v2.0! This major update includes a number of new features and improvements, but the most exciting new feature is the brand-new VS Code extension.

I've been working hard to make Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage the best tool for managing ephemeral development workspaces, and I think this new extension is a huge step in that direction. It provides a rich, graphical user interface for managing your workspaces, making it easier than ever to create, manage, and switch between your development environments.

## The New VS Code Extension

The new VS Code extension is the star of this release. It provides a number of features that make it easier than ever to manage your workspaces, including:

*   **A tree view of your workspaces:** The extension adds a new "Workspaces" view to the VS Code sidebar. This view displays a tree of all your available workspaces, making it easy to see and interact with them.
*   **Rich information about each workspace:** The tree view displays rich information about each workspace, including its Git status, current branch, and last commit.
*   **One-click workspace opening:** You can open any workspace in a new VS Code window with a single click.
*   **Context menu commands:** The extension provides a context menu for each workspace, allowing you to perform a variety of actions, such as warming the workspace, running the doctor, and deleting the workspace.

I'm really excited about this new extension, and I think you're going to love it. It's the perfect complement to the `workspace` command-line tool, and it makes managing your workspaces easier and more intuitive than ever before.

## Other Improvements

In addition to the new VS Code extension, this release also includes a number of other improvements, including:

*   **A more robust installation script:** The installation script is now more intelligent and robust, especially for Nix environments.
*   **A machine-readable output format for the `workspace` tool:** The `workspace` tool now includes a `--json` flag that provides a machine-readable output format. This makes it much easier to integrate the `workspace` tool with other tools, such as the new VS Code extension.
