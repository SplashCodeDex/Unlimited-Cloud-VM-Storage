I'm thrilled to announce the release of **Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage v2.0**! This is a massive update that brings a host of new features and improvements, headlined by a brand-new, feature-rich **VS Code extension**.

I've been working tirelessly to make Unlimited-Cloud-VM-Storage the most intuitive and powerful tool for managing ephemeral development workspaces.

## üöÄ The New VS Code Extension: Your Workspaces at Your Fingertips

The new VS Code extension is the star of this release. It brings the power of the `workspace` command directly into your editor, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

### Key Features of the Extension:

*   **üå≥ A Tree View of Your Workspaces:** The extension adds a new "Workspaces" view to the VS Code sidebar. This view displays a tree of all your available workspaces, making it easy to see and interact with them.

*   **üìä Rich Information About Each Workspace:** The tree view displays rich information about each workspace, including its Git status, current branch, and last commit.

*   **üñ±Ô∏è One-Click Workspace Opening:** You can open any workspace in a new VS Code window with a single click.

*   **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Context Menu Commands:** The extension provides a context menu for each workspace, allowing you to perform a variety of actions, such as warming the workspace, running the doctor, and deleting the workspace.

This extension is the perfect companion to the `workspace` command-line tool, and it makes managing your workspaces a breeze.

## üéÅ What's New in v2.0?

In addition to the new VS Code extension, this release is packed with other improvements:

*   **üß† More Intelligent Installation Script:** The installation script is now more intelligent and robust, especially for Nix environments. It will automatically detect your shell and install the necessary dependencies.

*   **ü§ñ Machine-Readable Output Format:** The `workspace` tool now includes a `--json` flag that provides a machine-readable output format. This makes it much easier to integrate the `workspace` tool with other tools, such as the new VS Code extension.

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Improvements:** I've made a number of performance improvements to the `workspace` tool, making it faster and more efficient than ever before.
